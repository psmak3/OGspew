# 10. The Sopranos
Ah, Tony Soprano: everyone's favorite anti-hero New Jersey gangster-type. He is definitely a powerful and memorable character, however what makes this show stand out above the other derivative broken-nose shows is the strength of the story lines and surrounding cast. Edie Falco excels as torn mob queen, Paulie, Silvo, and Christopher are classic paisanos, and the kids...well... they are just kids. The adventures of Tony and the gang obviously parallel that we have seen from Goodfellas, in fact many of the secondary characters (including Tony's psychiatrist) were in Goodfellas. 
But much like Goodfellas, I did not love it as much as everyone else on the planet. Some have this show as the best all time. And although it was ground-breaking and really started the golden age of TV (better writing, cinematography, and longer story arcs), I just can't shake that it is not as good as the Godfather. I know, not fair. But when you have seen the best in a genre, it is hard to not compare.


# 9. The Wire
Another HBO show that kickstarted the 'higher level of TV' movement. For those who do not know the show, it is a cops vs criminals urban opera set in Baltimore. What makes this series special though is the eerie feeling that this is real and these are not actors: it really plays like a documentary. We see the drug trade, turf battles, how the cops and government officials deal with the situations (spoiler: not all are on the up-and-up), how education factors, in, etc. It is a smorgasbord of inner-city drama. Yes, it is a socially-important show to watch. But no, it is not always entertaining. Some of the characters are distant and not really interesting, just vehicles used to move plot. Great show, but not the greatest.

# 8. Better Call Saul

# 5. Game of Thrones

# 4. Damages
